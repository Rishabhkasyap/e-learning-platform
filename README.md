# E-Learning Platform (MERN Stack)

## Project Overview

This **E-Learning Platform** is a full-stack web application built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). It provides a robust, scalable, and user-friendly platform for online learning where admins can upload courses and videos, and users can register, browse, and purchase courses.

- **Course Management**  
  Admin can add, update, and delete courses and video lectures.

- **Video Streaming**  
  Smooth playback of course videos with Cloudinary or any cloud storage integration.

- **Payment Integration**  
  Students can purchase courses using integrated payment gateways (e.g., Stripe).

- **Responsive UI**  
  Mobile-friendly interface built with React and Tailwind CSS.

- **User Dashboard**  
  Personalized dashboard for tracking enrolled courses and progress.
